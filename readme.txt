KISMET, a jewelry company

- Basic functional website for an emerging brand: kismet.
- Elegant and simple layout for comfortable user experience. 
- Navigation sidebar is constant on every page, including links to the brands' social media.
- Since customers are so important to brands, there will be an instagram feed on the main page, right when the user enters. It is connected to the brands instagram account and after every page refresh, will rotate images.
- Site would be great for future e-commerce integration. There is a section for the brands' collections, which will connect to the portal for purchasing.
- A contact page is essential for customer questions, comments, and feedback regarding product.
